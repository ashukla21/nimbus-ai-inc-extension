## Welcome!

Nimbus AI Inc. is a startup focused on developing free **Machine Learning Web Applications** for public use. 

Our current Apps Include:

- An AI **Image Styler** which was created using a CNN Neural Network.
- An AI **Stock Predictor** which was created using an LSTM Neural Network.
- A **Crypto Currency Data Analyzer** which provides analysis for 100 crypto currencies (ML functionality coming soon!).
- An AI **Face Generator** which was created using NVidia's Open Source APIs, MIT's free-to-use creative liscence and a Generative Adversarial Network.
- An AI **Text Editor** which provides users summarization, tokenization, translation, synonym functionality and more.
